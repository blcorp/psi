	Patch by Juan F. Codagnone:
	This patch was called originaly "miranda like type-ahead patch"  after the 
	Mozilla's and Miranda IM's feature. It lets you go to any contact in your 
	roster, typing his name. (at the moment, in psi, when you want to search for 
	some one, you need to type the first character of the nickname you are 
	searching for).
